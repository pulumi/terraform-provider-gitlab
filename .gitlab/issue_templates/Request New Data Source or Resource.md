## New Data Source / Resource

<!-- ðŸš§ Briefly describe the new data source or resource you are requested. 

An example config always helps, too. 
Make sure to add additional details you deem relevant.

A good description could look like this:

I'm missing a data source to retrieve details about all the issues of a given project.

I'm looking for something that I could use like this:

```hcl
resource "gitlab_project_issues" "all_issues" {
    project = "namespace/myproject"
}
```
